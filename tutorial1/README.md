## Creating a window

There are some window libraries that we could use. They are :

* GLUT -> Kind of always used. Kind of all as well. Doesn't blend well with 
          modern opengl contexts in some platforms ( like macOS )

* GLFW -> Modern library. Has support for many platforms and has VULKAN support.
          It allows us to create a bleeding edge opengl context.

The windowing library that I chose was GLFW, but it should be quite simple to port it
to GLUT if necessary. ( Like when you have a proffesor that lovec mac xD )
